This is the first project I have done from strach and with JS, CSS and HTML. This project it was requested by my university teacher in order to learn by ourselves how to do program a webpage.

In order to be able to see it you'll need to either download all the code into a ZIP and open the index file or go to GitHub --> Settings --> Pages --> Click the link.
